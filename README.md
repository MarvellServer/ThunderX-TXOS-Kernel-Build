# ThunderX-TXOS-Kernel-Build

 To build the kernel RPM you have to clone the git repository and use the build script.

   $ git clone https://github.com/MarvellServer/ThunderX-TXOS-Kernel-Build.git

   $ cd ThunderX-TXOS-Kernel-Build

   $ do_build=yes ./build.sh

 This will generate the build log and also kernel RPMS.

 NOTE: We assume that you have installed all the required dependency packages to compile kernel and generate RPM.
